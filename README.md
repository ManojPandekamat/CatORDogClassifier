# CatORDogClassifier
Classifies a 100*100 image of 3 channels (RGB) as Cat image or Dog image using convolutional neural networks model. It is implemented using Keras library in python


## Step 1
Download the data from this Link ðŸ‘‡
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dZvL1gi5QLwOGrfdn9XEsi4EnXx535bD

## Step 2
read the file using loadtext() funtion of Numpy library

## Step 3
If you are getting error in reading the test values, You can split the train data in 80:20 to train and test model.

## step 4
Run the CatOrDog.ipynb notebook to build train and test model

## Step 5
You can use model.predict() to test for new images.

Thank You !!!!!
